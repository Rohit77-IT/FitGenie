# FitGenie - Personalized Exercise Recommendations

FitGenie is a simple web application that provides personalized exercise recommendations based on user input. It takes basic health data, such as age, weight, height, and any pre-existing illnesses, and suggests suitable exercises for the user.

## Features
- **Personalized Exercise Recommendations**: Based on user input, the app generates exercise recommendations that are tailored to the user's health data.
- **Illness-Based Filtering**: The app filters out certain types of exercises based on the user's illness (e.g., HIIT for hypertension, strength training for heart disease).
- **Simple and User-Friendly**: Easy-to-use form that collects health data and displays exercise recommendations.
- **Responsive Layout**: The app is designed to be mobile-friendly and adapts to different screen sizes.

## How It Works
1. **Input Health Data**: The user fills out a form with their age, weight, height, and any existing illnesses.
2. **Generate Recommendations**: Upon submitting the form, the app processes the data and generates a list of recommended exercises.
3. **Filter Based on Illness**: If the user has certain illnesses, exercises such as HIIT or strength training may be filtered out to ensure safety.
4. **View Recommendations**: The recommended exercises are displayed, providing the user with a personalized workout plan.
